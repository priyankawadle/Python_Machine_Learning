## Machine Learning: 
   Machine which is trained on lots of data to identify prediction or make classification.
## Steps To follow while creating Model:
   1. Understand Buciness Problems
   2. Data Collection
   3. Data Cleaning & Exploration
   4. Build Model
   5. Collect Insight
## TYPES Machine Learning:
1. Supervised learning 
     1. Prediction ( regression) 
         a. Linear regression 
         b. Plinomial regression 
         c. Decision Tree Regression

                Analysis (PCA)
      3. Association Rule Learning
           a. Apriori Algorithm

## Supervised learning :
   Supervised learning is like teaching a computer how to do something by showing it examples.
   In Supervised learning, the model learns from labeled training data.
   # Example: Email Spam Detection
   Step1: Data Collection
   Step2: Training
   Step3: Testing
   # Algorithms:
   1. Classification : it is used to assign input data to predefined categories or classes. It works on discrete data.(categorical)
   2. Regression : it is used to predict a numerical value based on input features. It works on numerical data.(Continous)

   ## Regression :
   It is statisctical method that helps use understand and predict relationship between variables.
   Describes how one variable (Dependent/target variable) changes as another variable (Independent/feature varibles) changes.
   Dependent Variable: variable which we are trying to predict.
   Independent Variable: variales which we used to predict target.

   # Example: 
   predicting salary based on years of experience , 
   predicting exam score based on study hours, 
   predicting resale price based on vehicle age
